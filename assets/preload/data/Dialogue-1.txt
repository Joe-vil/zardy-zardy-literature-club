:player:This field. . . is full of incredibly cute scarecrows?!
::I look at all of them with astonishment.
:unknown:Hey, you're funny looking!
::Yeah, what are you? <3
::You're quite the odd scarecrow!
:zardy:Hey guys, this is quite rude of us to not introduce ourselves first, im Zardy!
:jacky:Hellooo im Pumpkin Jack, but i also go by Jacky!
:cable:My name is Cable Crow. What's your name, funny looking scarecrow?
:player:M-me??
::I'm still shocked… This is all happening so fast. I build up the courage to speak out.
::M-my name is Marton, Marton Torres.
:cable:Woah! What a bizarre name!
:jacky:Quite cool if you ask me!
:zardy:Okay guys, let's give Marton some space here, we don't want to freak our new guest out too much.
:player:I get up, still wondering if this is all real or if I hit my head on a rock when I passed out earlier…
::Maybe this is all a dream?
::All I know is that these scarecrows are smokin hot~!
:cable:Are you okay?
:player:W-what?
:jackyleave:I realized that I've been staring directly at Cable Crow completely zoned out.
:cable:Why are you staring at me like that? Is there something wrong?
:player:No no! I was just admiring your beauty!
::''Thats such a stupid response!'' you think to yourself.
::I look Cable Crow up and down, he's pretty cute. His soulless yet fulfilling eyes just bring me so much joy.
:cable:I don't think anyone has ever complimented me before...
::Hehe thanks!
:jacky:''Hey Marton!'' I hear from a distance.
:jackyreturn:Marton! Marton!
:player:Jacky came running down the maze out of breath
:zardy:Jacky? Where did you go? You were just right next to me.
:jacky:No time to explain, come on Marton lets go!
:player:''Wait, what's happening?'' I asked worryingly
:jacky:Oh come on! Stop being a scaredy cat!
:player:''Wait, hold on!'' You say.
::Go with Jacky or stay with Cable Crow?
