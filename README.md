zzlc source code

                            !UPDATE!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I know I've left this in the dark for a long time, almost 8 months now,
but I should say that development has come to a stop for now. I had a lot
of fun working on making this for some silly game jam and I learned a lot 
from making this but I don't really have the time anymore to work on this 
project. I'm going to make the GitHub public, the game has been updated since 
the initial release but it was never made public till now. ZZLC is now complete 
public so you can alter and do whatever you want with the code, just be sure to
leave me some credit haha.
